# ECE484SoloPB-PF
Frederick Levins Individual repo for playfield components and interaction. Part of larger scale team project on pinball machine. ECE484 Spring 2024 Final Prj.


Within the scope of the project involving a baseball centric game and system design for a pinball machine, my solo aspect is the design, development, and integration of an interactive playfield. As described below:

Design
- Baseball Centric requires designing similarities of real life game to pinball machine game design/logic
- board layout with replicate a baseball diamond
- Possibility to hit different types of hits: single, double, triple, homerun
- Interaction and completion of events to signify success
- Points will be distributed on a weighted scale with LEDs having varying colors to signify type of task completion

Development 
- Combination of various sensors and buttons with intent to be used as "triggers" for interaction, responce upon completion of game designed goals
- Buttons to be used upon applied pressure from ball to signify a point increase and flasing of LEDs/LCD screen prompt
- Motion Sensors (infrared, microwave, PIR) to be able to detect motion of ball in correlation to field for stats of distance of "hit" and rewards correlated
- Pressure Sensors are considered as well to make "outs" where a player hits a pre determined spot to lose points/balls - under consideration due to cost and complex
- Interaction compiled through Arduino or possible RSBPI
- All development and component usage is possible to change during testing and implementation cycle depending on prefernce and strenght of each item*

Integration
- Implementation onto to field using the base of the game machine: buttons in back to get hit, motion sensors along sides to track and detect motion
- LEDs and responce will be placed in various locations to celebrate success and give player feedback
- The outcomes and prompts will be baseball centric and correlated to the them to continue continuity and game design.

In conclusion, the playfield objective is to introduce and increase interaction levels of the game and entice the player further through fun and gameplay affect. This, in turn, is mostly UI/UX centric from the viewpoint of the game player.
